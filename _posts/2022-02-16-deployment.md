# Maggie PBL Plan

### Recommendations Page
I plan on creating a recommendations page than sorts through an API of videogames by genre. This way, the user can go through and see the games they are interested in without having to look through the entire set of games from the API.

Key Features:
* buttons for each genre
* cards that show up at the bottom of the page pertaining to the genre
* using javascript scroll reveal for the cards display
* worked with web designer to design frontend (html for "recommendations" page)

![CARDS IMAGE](https://github.com/florayuan18/pikachudrinkingwindex/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/images/cards.png)

### Google Search Function
Inspired by the tech talk, add the frontend and the backend for searching for any keyword on the site using the google search Javascript function.
