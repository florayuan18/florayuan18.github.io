# Quiz Plan
* Consists of questions with voice lines
* Users are asked to identify which character the voice line is from
* Quiz will be multiple choice
* Main java aspect of the quiz is polymorphism with sub classes and super classes

![Week 9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72881876/153632424-22a6b4f2-6345-4a80-9ce7-22c2fd17a2ba.png)

# Integration with Theme
* The Quiz will fit the same color scheme and font of our current look (Cyan and "8-bit font)
* The Quiz utilizes the layout that was created by the web designer
* Will work with Kira (Web Designer) to ensure cohesion

# Week By Week

## Week 1
* Planning (Design)
* Starting basis of website (Controls, page running, inserting layout)
* Research (Is This a Viable Project?)

## Week 2
* CODE, CODE, CODE
* Talk to Mortensen about adding sounds in java
* Work on turning games into subclasses
* Mostly Backend Work

## Final Week
* Front End
* Finishing touches

### Code Breakdown
- Each question represented by an object of the Voiceline class
- Contains subclasses for each character
- Inherits two incorrect answers, has unique voice line for each subclass
- Objects are put into an arraylist then converted to JSON for use in javascript
