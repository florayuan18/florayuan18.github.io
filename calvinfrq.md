## Frq 2:
I solidifed my concepts of using classes and this. I also leared the use of a void class.

## Frq 3:
I used numbers with my variables here. I furthered practiced using classes as that is what I struggled with. I didn't really stuggle with the operations as I've already done things like this in python. I also used if and if else.

## Frq 4:
Here I praacticed how to manipulate strings. This was origniall a bit of a challenge but I quickly realized how simple this task was. I used nested loops and compared the values used and or.

## Frq 5:
Here I made a password generator using math.random. This is the first frq that used it so it was a good review on how to use it.

## Frq 6:
I maipulated arrays in this frq. It was a good review on how to do this.

## Frq 7:
This was a fun frq as I got to use arraylists and maipulate them using .add and .remove. It was also the first time I used an array as an object

## Frq 8: 
This was the fist time I used a 2d array. I struggled figuring how to put objects into a 2d array but I figured it out soon enough. It was also intersting to iterate through the 2d array in order to find the values I wanted. I also never thoguht to used a method in my for loops like plot.getCropType.equals("corn")
