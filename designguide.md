## Brainwrite:
We all like video games and we want a way to look for new games to play. To do this, we can create a library of games that can be sorted by genre, difficulty, type, etc to find games that fit our preferences. Our aesthetic inspiration is an 80s arcade. Want bright colors and large emphasis on good styling. Most of our technicals will involve databasing.
