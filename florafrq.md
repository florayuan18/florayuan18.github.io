## FRQ 1 - Unit 2 Light Sequence
- Unit 2 focused on using objects, so I learned how to create these objects and implement them to use math functions.

## FRQ 2 - Unit 3 Dinner
- Unit 3 focused on boolean expressions and if statements
- I learned how to use these expressions/statements to guides a program to make decisions based on specified criteria.

## FRQ 3 - Unit 4 Longest Streak
- Unit 4 focused on iteration
- By doing this FRQ, I became more familiar with the format of a for loops and working with nested iteration
- Parts for the header: initialization (int i = 1), boolean expression (i < input.length), and increment/decrement (i++ or i--)

## FRQ 4 - Unit 4 Coin Game
- Unit 4 focused on iteration 
- By doing this FRQ, I learned how become more familiar with creating the while loops.
- I incorporated if statements in order to guide the program 

## FRQ 5 - Unit 5 Invitation
- Unit 5 focused on writing classes
- I learned how to set up classes as well as use concatenation to display for the frontend.

## FRQ 6 - Unit 5 Password Generator
- Unit 5 focused on writing classes
- I learned how to set up the different components of a class, namely using the "this keyword" and using for loops to generate the password (i++) 

## FRQ 7 - Unit 6 Payroll
- Unit 6 focused on arrays
- I learned how to set up an array with the given College Board values
- I learned how to traverse the array using a for loops
- As the for loop moves on, it goes through each place on the array, starting with 0.  The array goes through.  If the condition in the if statement is satisfied, the integer is set to the value in the array.

## FRQ 8 - Unit 7 Username
- Unit 7 focused on arraylists and sorting
-
