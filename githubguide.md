## Purpose
- To organize pull requests and commits
- To prevent commit errors and loss of code
- To organize and efficiently delegate tasks
- To avoid committing files that donâ€™t belong in version control

## GitHub Project Setup
- ReadMe to organize journals, commits, profiles, and individual issues
- ReadMe must be frequently updated by all team members
- Inclusion of a .gitignore file to ensure that files not tracked by Git remain untracked
- Additional lines may be added into the .gitignore file to tell GitHub to ignore them, with the consensus of group members
- .idea files:

## Scrum Board
- Split up into different sections to track progress (To Do, In Progress, Teacher Review Ready, and Done columns)
- Individual issues that are assigned and labeled appropriately at the beginning of the week
- Individual issues must be moved to the Done column and closed once completed
- Tasks must be completed in the week assigned unless deadlines are extended
- Members must look 3 weeks ahead to plan accordingly

## Pull Requests
- Members will try not force pushes by and instead discuss with others in the team to problem solve
- Topic branches will be used for pull requests
- Team members will tell one another when they have pushed to the topic branch
- Team members will pull changes by the end of each class period
- For larger technicals, pull requests will be drafted and created
- Members can push commits from the topic branch and add them to the pull request
- Other members will review proposed changes, add review comments, and possibly add their own commits to the pull request

## Branches Techniques
- Individual technicals will be conducted on separate branches
- Git-checkout will be used to update individual branches
- Only merge after checking with other members to prevent merging errors
- Rebasing can be for the entire branch or just a single commit

## How to Create and Merge a Branch
- Merging to master the most common way to integrate results of work back into the main code base
- Integrated into the head of the target branch
- Click checkout to switch to a branch (under Git)
- Branches popup - Branches
- Rebasing branches (git-rebase)
- Rebasing from one branch to the other
- Rebase operation integrates changes on feature branch to master branch by applying commits on top of current HEAD commit in master
- Git | Rebase - choose target branch to which you want to rebase to
- Can do rebasing from a particular commit instead of entire branch
- Modify options and choose --onto
- Enter the hash of the commit

## Forks
- No forks (independent of the original repository) will be used
