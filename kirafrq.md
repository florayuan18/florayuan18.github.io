All FRQs can be found [here.](https://replit.com/@4DISEASE/CSATri2#Main.java)
Use the text menu to select which FRQ to view and input the corresponding number in the console to view the FRQ response. 

## FRQ 2 Reflection
In this FRQ, the purpose was to create and alter a string. I used a simple implementation using constructors, setters, getters, and methods to alter the strings to fulfill the requirements of the FRQ. It was a good review of string methods and insertion, as well as object creation.

## FRQ 3 Reflection
This FRQ emulates a dinner party invitation. The FRQ takes the values of the variables and evaluates them using if statements. This FRQ was a good review on the structure of if statements and using conditions to evaluate and print a result. I also reviewed data dypes such as boolean and string values.

## FRQ 4 Reflection
This FRQ takes in a string and finds the character that is repeated in a row the most. My implementation is based on iteration over the characters in the list. The use of a for loop alloweds for checking each character against the next to find when the longest repeated character sequence is in the inputted string.

## FRQ 5 Reflection
This FRQ takes in user input and creates an invite. It includes toString methods, getters, and setters. It was a a good challenge to put in user input with this FRQ, and it was a review in returning and toString methods.

## FRQ 6 Reflection
The FRQ takes in a list of words and only prints out the words that end in -ing. I was able to practice iteration with this FRQ, as well as if statements and a few string methods. I had to use string length and loops to find out which words ended in -ing. 

## FRQ 7 Reflection
In this FRQ, the purpose is to create methods that take in a first name and last name and generate possible usernames out of them. To do this, I used certain string operations, for loops, and worked with lists. It was a good review on how to use enhanced for loops along with lists.

## FRQ 8 Reflection
The FRQ's purpose is to simulate a crop field and use specific methods to compare the crops. This FRQ was a good review of 2d arrays and how to traverse them. It also helped me to review test methods, as generating an example crop field and running methods on it required a lot of testing.

## FRQ 9 Reflection
The first part of this FRQ's purpose is to simulate different kinds of books. For this FRQ, I made use of superclasses and subclasses to simulate regular books and picture books. The second part of the FRQ, where the purpose was to simulate animals, also made use of superclasses and subclasses. I felt that it was a good review of constructors in relation to subclasses and superclasses.

## FRQ 10 Reflection
This last FRQ's purpose was to create a mathematical method that gets the greatest common factor of two different numbers. This FRQ was a good review of if statements and converting math operations to code.
