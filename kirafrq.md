## FRQ 2 Reflection
In this FRQ, the purpose was to create and alter a string. I used a simple implementation using constructors, setters, getters, and methods to alter the strings to fulfill the requirements of the FRQ. It was a good review of string methods and insertion, as well as object creation.

## FRQ 3 Reflection
This FRQ emulates a dinner party invitation. The FRQ takes the values of the variables and evaluates them using if statements. This FRQ was a good review on the structure of if statements and using conditions to evaluate and print a result. I also reviewed data dypes such as boolean and string values.

## FRQ 4 Reflection
This FRQ takes in a string and finds the character that is repeated in a row the most. My implementation is based on iteration over the characters in the list. The use of a for loop alloweds for checking each character against the next to find when the longest repeated character sequence is in the inputted string.
