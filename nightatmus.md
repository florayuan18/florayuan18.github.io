## What I've Learned
I've learned more about the complete picture of creating a feature.  By creating the feature, I had to think of the full picture, figuring out how the mapping related to the html and css.  I learned how to work around issues with trial and error.  While it might seem time consuming, it helps me understand, in my detail, how each line in my code functions.  By switching little things within my code, it builds this sense of understanding.
