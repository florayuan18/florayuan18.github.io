## Study Week 2
Requirements
## Clear Plan 
April 29th:
* Google Search Function implemented
* Include the search bar on each page

May 13th: 
* Link Search Bar for PubMed (Database of Articles)

## Comments/Runtime
* Comments: I try to add comments while I'm writing the code.  I have some examples [here](https://github.com/adhithin/lab-kit/commit/5f74eac19c8fffeac6dce786c481139dc2784c0e#diff-3f3f2220cec1e70ea83c19acc461921e51bf7c5821405d1ea9e555a917ff69d2R141-R173).

## Tangibles, Sponsor, Coding Reflection
* PBL --> We kind of talked about this in class, but I think everyone in the group is a bit confused on how to move forward with the project.  The PBL tidbits we're taking on don't seem to be super clear, so we are thinking of restructuring the project as a whole.  For now, I worked on creating some sort of login page for the website.
* [some pbl before switch](https://github.com/adhithin/lab-kit/commit/5f74eac19c8fffeac6dce786c481139dc2784c0e)
* Sponsor: We are not in contact with our sponsor right now.
* I'm writing this reflection a little after I already had this code ready.  I think it was very difficult to figure out what exactly to do due to no contact with the sponsor/our scrum leader.  This code was originally from when I tried to make a login page.  I couldn't quite figure out how to use a database on my own, but I'm assuming that we will continue to need a login page in our new project.  Therefore, I will be consulting both my team members and Mr. Mort in order to finally figure out this issue I have been struggling with for a while.  I think going through this process, I've learned that I lack the creative thinking that good coders have, which gets me stuck on certain ideas.  I think I need to do more exploring within my projects to fix this.
