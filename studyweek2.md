## Study Week 2
Requirements
* MCQ results
* ![studyweek2.png](/assets/img/studyweek2.png)

Reflection: I think that for taking the test with no studying, I did pretty okay.  I think that I have a good amount of the basic concepts, but I need to brush up on other concepts.  I think my next steps moving forward would just be to watch more of the university lectures and applying the knowledge to the PBL projects.

* FRQ results (didn't do/not taking the test)
* Effort/Ticket/GH Pages

## PBL Focus + Reflection
* PBL --> We kind of talked about this in class, but I think everyone in the group is a bit confused on how to move forward with the project.  The PBL tidbits we're taking on don't seem to be super clear, so we are thinking of restructuring the project as a whole.  FOr now, I worked on creating some sort of login page for the website.
